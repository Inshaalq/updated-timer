The "Nerve of Steel" game challenges players to stay standing for an unpredictable amount of time. The last one to sit wins!

Rules:
All players stand when the game starts.
The program will wait for a random duration between 5 to 25 seconds.
Players can choose to sit down at any time during the wait.
Once the waiting time is up, players still standing are eliminated.
The last player to sit down is crowned the winner.
